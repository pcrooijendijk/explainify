It is our recommendation to secure this parser against XXE attacks by configuring $FACTORY with `xmlReader.setFeature(http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl, true)`. Alternatively, the following configurations also provide protection against XXE attacks. `xmlReader.setProperty(XMLConstants.ACCESS_EXTERNAL_DTD, \"\")` `xmlReader.setFeature(\"http://xml.org/ sax/features/external-general-entities\", false)`.
